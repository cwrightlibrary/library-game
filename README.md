# Library Game

## Concept
You’re a volunteer for the day, help out librarians complete their tasks for the day to win.

## To-Do
### Broader Console Goals
- [ ] Write a python application with PySimpleGUI that runs when the Pi is started. From there, boot the game. Console menu, design should be like Switch.
### Complete Tasks
- [ ] **Fix Word Search allow_range table**
- [x] Print Documents
- [ ] Drum Hero
- [ ] Word Search
- [x] Astronomy Search
- [x] In Astronomy Search, make the light glow red when the constellation is far, yellow when nearer, green when at least one star is onscreen
### Core Game
- [ ] Complete library design/layout
- [ ] Create dialog for different players
- [ ] Make music and sfx
- [ ] Find a good way to transition between the core game and tasks (*Maybe stop the cls() and generate random black dots until the screen is covered, then reverse it with the new task/core*)
- [ ] Track the player's progress visually
- [ ] Procedural NPC generation (create a base sprite set and change features randomly for variation)
